Project Title
Automobile Sales Tracker: Profit, Discounts & Delivery Analysis 

## Description
This project analyzes automobile sales performance, cost of goods sold (COGS), discounts, and delivery outcomes. It tracks monthly sales trends, salesperson performance, customer delivery satisfaction, and profit margins across brands and states.

## Problem Statement
- Auto dealerships often struggle with:
- Monitoring profitability by brand and region
- Understanding the impact of discounts on profits
- Tracking sales performance by method, year, and salesperson
- Assessing delivery performance and customer satisfaction
This dashboard provides a compact, interactive Excel-based solution for executives to monitor key metrics and make better data-driven decisions.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables
Charts: Bar, Line, Donut, Map
Conditional Formatting

## Process Summary
### Data Cleaning:
- Removed blanks, standardized brand and state names
- Restructured sales records for pivot compatibility
### Data Modeling:
- Linked monthly sales, delivery status, COGS, discounts, and salesperson tables
- Created calculated columns for profit, margin, and delivery rates
### Dashboard Design:
- KPI cards (Total Revenue, COGS, Profit, Margin, Orders)
- Visuals: Profit by salesperson, payment method, region, model year
- Trend analysis by month and brand
- Delivery rating distribution donut chart

## Key Insights
- Top Performer: Sarah Connor ($3.9M profit)
- Best States: Texas and California show highest average margins
- Honda leads in sales but also has the highest COGS
- Debit Card & Financing are dominant payment methods
- Discounts significantly boost profits ($10.7M with discounts vs. $7.4M without)
- Most Customers Satisfied – 57.29% orders are "Delivered"

## Recommendations
- Incentivize high-margin states with tailored promotions
- Encourage profitable payment methods (e.g., Debit & Financing)
- Reconsider discount strategy to optimize profit boost without overuse
- Prioritize delivery process improvements for “Processing” and “In Transit” categories
- Track sales per model year to avoid overstocking low-profit years (e.g., 2020)
- Recognize and reward top sales performers with bonus incentives

## Challenges & Fixes
- Too many slicers and filters → Grouped logically and added a Clear All button
- Map visual performance → Limited to top states with sufficient data
